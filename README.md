## Description

In this project, the task is to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI in a Weather Journal application with JavaScript.

- Create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com to request weather data.
- Creat a local server producing feedback to the Command Line through a working callback function.
- Dynamically Update the UI using event listeners with the data returned from OpenWeatherMap as well as individual input.
